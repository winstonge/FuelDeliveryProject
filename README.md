Fuel Delivery Project 

Hereunder a brief description of the Fuel Delivery project.
The application consist of three parts a back-end, front-end and mobile hand-held (Windows Mobile).

The original application was build in java (Back-end) and the front-end in Adobe flex. I decided to port the application to a
newer version of Spring and to build the front-end using Polymer. 

The mobile devices will connect to the controllers to post and get the necessary data.
